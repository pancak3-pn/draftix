const privacy = [
  ["What we collect", <ul><li><strong>Anonymous session IDs.</strong> When you open DRAFTIX, a random identifier is created so draft rooms and tournaments can recognize you. It is not tied to an email, password, or profile.</li><li><strong>Draft session data.</strong> Nicknames, team names, chat messages, picks and bans, and optional team logos are stored in a database for the life of the session so every participant sees the same board.</li><li><strong>Visit counts.</strong> A first-party cookie (<code>dx_v</code>) holds a random ID and records the page you view and the site that linked you here. No IP address, device fingerprint, or advertising identifier is recorded.</li><li><strong>Presence.</strong> While a page is open, a heartbeat notes which page you are on so the live player counter stays current.</li><li><strong>Feedback.</strong> If you submit feedback, your star rating, message, and the page you were on are stored.</li><li><strong>Client errors.</strong> If the app crashes in your browser, the error message, technical trace, page, and browser version are recorded so the failure can be diagnosed and fixed.</li><li><strong>Browser storage.</strong> Preferences such as your nickname, your “My tournaments” list, and a cached agent catalog are kept in your browser and stay on your device.</li></ul>],
  ["What we do not collect", <ul><li>No accounts, passwords, or email addresses.</li><li>No advertising networks, cross-site trackers, or data brokers.</li><li>No IP addresses in analytics — the random cookie ID is the only visitor identifier.</li><li>No sale or sharing of data; there is nothing to sell.</li></ul>],
  ["How long data lives", <ul><li><strong>Draft sessions</strong> are deleted when the room is closed or automatically two hours after the last activity, together with their players, chat, and logos.</li><li><strong>Presence rows</strong> are deleted after one hour of inactivity.</li><li><strong>Abuse-prevention records</strong>, keyed by your anonymous ID or IP address, are deleted within one to two days.</li><li><strong>Client error reports</strong> (message, trace, page, browser) are deleted after 30 days.</li><li><strong>Tournaments</strong> are kept in the database so organizers and spectators can return to the bracket.</li><li><strong>Pageview rows</strong> (path, referring site, random ID) are retained for product statistics.</li></ul>],
  ["Organizer tokens", <p>Creating a tournament issues a one-time organizer token. The token itself is stored only in the organizer’s browser; the server keeps just an irreversible SHA-256 hash. Anyone holding the token or the manage link can control that tournament, so treat it like a password.</p>],
  ["Third-party services", <ul><li><strong>valorant-api.com</strong> supplies Valorant map names and splash images. Your browser requests this data directly, so the provider sees your IP address as with any web request.</li><li><strong>Supabase</strong> hosts the database and realtime connections that run drafts.</li><li><strong>Ko-fi</strong> processes voluntary donations when users follow that external link.</li><li>Fonts and agent artwork are served from our own domain; no font CDN is used.</li></ul>],
  ["Children", <p>DRAFTIX has no age gate and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Use of the service remains subject to local law.</p>],
  ["Your choices", <ul><li>Block or delete the <code>dx_v</code> cookie at any time — the site keeps working, only visit counting stops.</li><li>Clear “My tournaments” or your browser storage to remove saved organizer tokens and preferences from your device.</li></ul>],
